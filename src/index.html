	<h3>Beacon Hill: A historic district</h3>
	<h4>History</h4>
	<p>According to Boston City Hall, Beacon Hill got its name from a beacon that at one point sat up on the
		hill to warn people about foreign invasion. Development began on the hill in 1795 with the construction of the
		State House, and then residential development subsequently followed. In 1795, the Mount Vernon Proprietors,
		made up of six wealthy citizens, was created. The organization is considered to be one of the first land
		development operations in the country. Charles Bulfinch completed the State House in 1797, and major residential
		development began in 1800.</p>
	<h4>Architectural Style</h4>
	<p>Three types of structures characterize Beacon Hill’s early period: Freestanding mansion (These homes,
		though there were not too many of them built, had large plots of land surrounding a large public square.) Pairs
		of houses symmetrical in design. Row house: multiple attached houses with the same design. These three
		types are built mostly in the Federal and Greek Revival Style.
